# Python-Snake-Game

A snake game written in Python using the Turtle module first project.

The Python-Snake-Game project is a classic game in which the player controls a snake that moves around the screen and eats food to grow larger while avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake's own tail. The game is built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, which allows for better organization and modularity of the code.

Some of the key concepts learned in this project include:

- Creating classes and objects to represent game entities such as the snake and the food
- Using inheritance to create subclasses with specific behaviors or attributes
- Implementing game logic such as collision detection and scorekeeping
- Using Turtle library for game development

# Installing & Running the application (Written using PyCharm)

Download the Python 3 installer package from the official website and install it, if not installed previously.

Download the source code from the repository and run the file just as any other Python script (.py) file.

# Enjoy this simple game!

Use the arrow keys to move the snake around, consume the red dots to keep growing, and avoid hitting the snakeâ€™s tail.
